# Classification on Gamma Telescope Dataset

Jupyter notebook related to the use of Machine Learning classification techniques on the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset for a university course (MSc, 1st year, 2020).

Techniques that I compared:
- Linear SVM
- Kernel SVM
- Logistic regression
- LDA
- QDA
- Classification trees
- Random forests

Accuracies were compared performing Stratified k-CV. Data were preprocessed with nonlinear transformations and the dimensionality was reduced with PCA.


I used Python and Scikit-learn.
